#The Plan

This file is a resource to see the progress on the project and how it progresses. It will be updated whenever a new development comes in or a new feature is added. I don't have any idea how this is gonna work, but I will try my best to document the making of this piece of software as detailed as possible.


Currently the idea is to have a static js file that does all the work. It will have all the html components as well as ways to update the comment sections inside the one single file.

I am still not sure on where I want trailing comments or not, if I do, it might get a little tricky. So keeping it simple, singular comments for now. 

```
        [comments.js file] <----------------------|
                |                                 |
	        |                                 |
                V                                 V
User --> Comment Component --> [Datafile where the comments will be stored]
                                                    |
  ^                                                 |
